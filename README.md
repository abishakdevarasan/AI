This technology is rapidly evolving, and neither the scientific community nor industry agree on a common definition.

Some common definitions of AI include:

A branch of computer science dealing with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers.
Advanced statistical and analytical methods such as machine learning and artificial neural networks, especially deep learning.
A computer system able to perform specific tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
